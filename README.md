## Features

- **High Speed:** Simulate attacks at various speeds to test your defenses.
- **Secure:** Built with security in mind to minimize risks during testing.
- **User-Friendly:** Easy to use with a straightforward command-line interface.
- **Configurable:** Customize parameters to fit your testing needs.
